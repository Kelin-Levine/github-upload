My almost-kind-of-partially-not-really functional simplified Canvas assignment planner.

**Requires a file named `.env` placed in the script's running directory to function. File must contain following text:**
```
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=(token here)
```
**replacing '(token here)' with a valid canvas access token for the account to be used.**
